## My Pantry:
Is an pantry inventory application that allows the user to login to create, edit, and remove items from their pantry. Keep track of the items in your home pantry to help with creating grocery lists and/or checking your own inventory to see what ingredients you have for a specific recipe.

## Technologies Used
HTML
CSS Flexbox
Bootstrap
JavaScript
Express.js
React.js
Node.js
Mongo
Mongoose

## Approach Taken
Started by creating a schema with the relevant info needed for the app.

Created a basic index page and route and mapped over the database display items.  Created divs for each category from the select option on the create page.

Created show ,edit, and create routes and pages.

Added Styling with CSS Flexbox and Bootstrap


## Unsolved Problems
I need to learn the logic to be able to increase or decrease the qty of an item by a specific amount each time the Add One button or Use One button is clicked.


## Future additions
- Pull in an API that has grocery items that can be called in as opposed to adding each one separately.
- Allow a user to add an image from their phone as opposed to only having an Image URL field on the new page
- Add a separate Grocery List page.  Currently have to scroll to the bottom of the page to see grocery list
