## Future additions
- Pull in an API that has grocery items that can be called in as opposed to adding each one separately.
- Allow a user to add an image from their phone as opposed to only having an Image URL field on the new page
- Add a separate Grocery List page.  Currently have to scroll to the bottom of the page to see grocery list
